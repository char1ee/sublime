#Highlighter

A plugin for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) (ST2 and ST3) to highlight mixed
tabs and spaces, some unicode characters and trailing space.

These characters are highlighted by default:  
**U+2026** Horizontal ellipsis  
**U+2018** Left single quotation mark  
**U+2019** Right single quotation mark  
**U+201c** Left double quotation mark  
**U+201d** Right double quotation mark  
**U+2013** en dash  
**U+2014** em dash  

You can also add a custom regex for characters to highlight.
See the default settings file for settings you can customise.

This plugin used to be called *Highlight Mixed Whitespace*, renamed because it does a little more now.

Shamelessly ripped from https://github.com/SublimeText/TrailingSpaces and modified.
